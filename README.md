# Fabric Defect Detection using CNN

### 🧠 Problem Statement
In the fashion industry, a lot of fabric is wasted because quality checks are still done by hand. Manual inspection takes a lot of time, depends on human judgment, and often misses small defects. This leads to higher production costs and more textile waste, which harms the environment.

This project aims to create an automated fabric inspection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that can quickly and accurately detect defects such as holes, stains, or uneven textures in fabric images. By using AI for quality control, the project helps reduce fabric waste, improve efficiency, and promote sustainable textile manufacturing.
